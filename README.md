# Object Tracker

A repository containing a ROS2 package that enables object detection and object-following maneuvers using a simple blob detector and a PID controller.

The object tracker is divided into two nodes: one to detect the object of interest, and the other to calculate the twist (linear and angular velocities) commands to follow the object.
